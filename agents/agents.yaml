# Agents definitions: ARCHIVED
# This project now uses a template-based manual workflow instead of automated generation.
# See docs/templates/README.md and docs/templates/LLM_PROMPT.md for the new workflow.

# Previous agent definitions (archived for reference):
# - reader: Used to auto-generate intro pages from specs (REPLACED by manual templates + LLM)
# - marketer: Used to expand intros with marketing text (REPLACED by manual editing or LLM)
# - designer: Used to auto-generate CSS (REPLACED by manual editing of docs/assets/style.css)
# - tester: Validates that templates and tools are present (UPDATED in scripts/test_page.sh)
# - deployer: Publishes to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (AUTOMATED in .github/workflows/)

# Current workflow:
# 1. Copy docs/templates/sample-page.html to docs/<project-id>.html
# 2. Edit manually or use an LLM with docs/templates/LLM_PROMPT.md
# 3. Commit to main → GitHub Actions publishes to gh-pages
